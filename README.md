## **_Installation_**
Here are some guidelines for installing the project on your local machine in order to be able to try it:

2. Change the working directory to ```cd Develop/```

3. Run ```npm i``` to download all the dependencies. 

4. Run ```node index.js``` in your terminal to launch the application, the first question will appear in your terminal. 

5. Enjoy and don't hesitate to contribute! ðŸ™‚
